phase_1:
What is a buffer overflow attack?
How did you get the buffer size?
    - 0x28 in getbuf
    - know how to execute the answer .. cat p1.txt | ./hex2dec | ./ctarget
   

phase_2:
How do you find addr of stack pointer (rsp)?
    - Go past getbuf, input a very long string, the print rsp addr (x/s $rsp).. The string takes care of filling the stack
How do you construct the instruction?
    - Show how you move the cookie into the rdi register 
    - gc -c p2.s
    - objdump -d p2.o > p2.d
    - Cat p2.d and see the addr of the rdi register being used
   
phase_3:
    - Show how you pad the first line in the text file (rsp + 0x38)
    - Show you construct move instruction 
    - used "unit-conversion.info/texttools/hexidecimal" to convert cookie into hextext
    
phase_4:
    - What is an ROP attack?
    - How do you find teh gadgets for phase4?
    - Show how the rax starts at a specific byte so you have to add to it to get correct address
